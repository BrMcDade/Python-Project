The provided Python code is from "Chapter 10 programing exercise 1. Pet Class."

This Python project revolves around the Pet class, designed to manage and display information about pets. Here's a breakdown of what the project does:

Class Definition (Pet): The code defines a class named Pet with attributes for the name, animal type, and age of a pet. It includes methods to set and get these attributes, ensuring encapsulation and data integrity.

Input Prompting and Object Creation: The main() function prompts the user to input details about their pet, such as its name, type (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird), and age. It then creates a Pet object using the provided details.

Displaying Pet Details: After creating the Pet object, the program displays the pet's information on the screen, including its name, animal type, and age. This allows users to verify the details they entered and view them in a structured format.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: The project showcases fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, such as class definition, instance creation, encapsulation, and method invocation. It demonstrates how to define a class to represent real-world entities (in this case, pets) and interact with objects of that class.

Overall, this project serves as a practical example of OOP principles in Python, providing a template for managing and displaying information about pets through a simple command-line interface.
